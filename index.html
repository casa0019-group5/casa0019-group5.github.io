                        To gauge the water usage throughout the day, the team started with the incoming MQTT Data stream from One Pool Street.
                        This data gets updated every few minutes from two sensors located on every residence floor, which are identified using the IDs of SAC1 and SAC2. 
                        The data coming from the sensors represent the current total water usage from the time the sensors turned on, till now.
                        To convert this data to show how the water usage changes throughout the day, we created a database to store the historical data from the MQTT stream.
                        The added benefit to this was allowing for both apps to shift away from subscribing to 32 different MQTT streams, and instead conducting HTTP requests to 1 of 6 endpoints.

                        The physical device shows the real-time water usage in UCL One Pool Street using syringes and LEGO servo. 
                        Once the power supply connects to the device, the Neopixel illustrates the x100 Litres usage, the syringes are used to show *10 Litres water and the LEGO servo is used to control the flow of water. 
                        Afterwards it will wait for the next data come in for 10 minutes, and repeat the process. 
                        while the water level reaches a certain threshold, it will go back to the initial state and one more light on Neopixel will turn on.

                        The Digital Twin of the data device provides additional information. It includes the sum of SAC1 and SAC2 for each individual floor in One Pool Street. In addition, it includes the total value for SAC1 and SAC2 separately in a barchart. Therefore, we can compare the difference in water usage between the separate sections of One Pool Street.

                            Open the app and point the screen at the water droplet. The augmented reality will display a dashboard showcasing water usage data for each floor and the total usage as a bar chart individually for SAC1 and SAC2.
